The Lehigh Valley Railroad was not only a coal carrier, but also a diversified railroad that hauled various commodities and products, such as cement, steel, lumber, grain, milk, and automobiles. It also had a significant passenger service, offering both local and long-distance trains. One of its most famous passenger trains was the Black Diamond Express, which ran from New York to Buffalo via Easton, Allentown, Bethlehem, Wilkes-Barre, Sayre, Geneva, and Rochester. The train was named after the anthracite coal it carried as part of its baggage and express service. The train was known for its high speed, punctuality, and luxury. It featured Pullman sleeping cars, dining cars, observation cars, and coaches. The train also had a distinctive paint scheme of Cornell red with black trim and gold lettering.
 
The Lehigh Valley Railroad faced many challenges and difficulties throughout its history, such as competition from other railroads, labor disputes, natural disasters, economic downturns, and government regulations. The railroad entered bankruptcy twice: once in 1939 and again in 1970. The railroad tried to survive by cutting costs, selling assets, merging with other railroads, and modernizing its equipment and facilities. However, these efforts were not enough to overcome the decline in traffic and revenue. In 1976, the Lehigh Valley Railroad ceased to exist as an independent entity and became part of Conrail, a government-created corporation that consolidated several bankrupt northeastern railroads.
 
Today, much of the former Lehigh Valley Railroad main line is still in use by Norfolk Southern Railway and CSX Transportation. Some of the secondary lines are operated by short line railroads or preserved as rail trails. Many of the stations, depots, bridges, tunnels, and other structures built by the Lehigh Valley Railroad still stand as reminders of its legacy. The Lehigh Valley Railroad Historical Society is a non-profit organization that preserves and promotes the history of the railroad and its impact on the communities it served. The society operates a museum in Shortsville, New York, where it displays artifacts, photographs, documents, and models related to the Lehigh Valley Railroad.
